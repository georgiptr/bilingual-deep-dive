# bilingual-deep-dive

Deep dive into an intellectual odyssey with a deep learning model designed to bridge linguistic divides. This project unveils a groundbreaking dual-task approach, enabling a basic LLM to not only comprehend and respond to instructions in English but also to navigate the linguistic nuances of Bulgarian. Witness the transformation of a simple text-generating LLM into a bilingual maestro, adept at following instructions across languages without prior explicit Bulgarian training. This venture marks the pinnacle of my deep learning course, illustrating the fusion of language learning and AI in a quest to transcend linguistic barriers. Join us on this pioneering journey to redefine the capabilities of machine learning in mastering multilingual communication!
